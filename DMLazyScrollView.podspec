You can use it to load images or entire views without pain.  s.homepage     = "https://github.com/sunchongyang/DMLazyScrollView"    s.screenshot   = "https://camo.githubusercontent.com/89997fafa4d179c982a48e4ca0a0421b532e3bcb/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6c686d646e2e706e67"  s.authors            = { "Daniele Margutti (me@danielemargutti.com)"ï¼Œ"Sun Chongyang" => "sunchongyang@dangdang.com" }  s.source       = { :git => "https://github.com/sunchongyang/DMLazyScrollView.git" }  s.source_files  = "DMLazyScrollViewExample/DMLazyScrollView", "DMLazyScrollViewExample/DMLazyScrollView/*.{h,m}"  s.requires_arc = trueend
